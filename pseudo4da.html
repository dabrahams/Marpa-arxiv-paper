<p>Here's pseudo-code for recreated the missing Leo completions for the
causation of the EIM <tt>top</tt> with a causation whose mainstem is the LIM
<tt>lim0</tt>
and whose tributary is the EIM <tt>baseEIM</tt>.  Note that top may have more than
one causation, and the others may be either Leo or ordinary causations.

<p>A causation is a duple of mainstem and tributary.  It is the pair of
parse items which caused the creation of a parse item.  In an ambiguous
parse, parse items may have more than one causation.
I have previously called the mainstems, predecessors;
and called the tributaries, causes, components or bases.
We can write a causation as <tt>[ m, t ]</tt>,
where <tt>m</tt> is the mainstem
and <tt>t</tt> is the tributary.

<p>"Require" means that the EIM is to be added to the ES, or
the causation is to be added to the parse item, unless it
already exists.
In Libmarpa, the nulled EIMs are added at the same time,
but the logic to do this is not shown here.

<pre>
workingLIM = lim0
previousCompletion = baseEIM
while workingLIM exists
do
    <font face="serif"># LIMs always have exactly one causation</font>
    [ previousLIM, workingBase ] = causation(workingLIM)
    <font face="serif">Let</font> completion <font face="serif">be a new EIM such that</font>
        DR(completion) = Next(DR(workingBase))
	Origin(completion) = Origin(workingBase)
    <font face="serif">Require</font> completion<!--
       --> <font face="serif">in</font> Current(top)
    <font face="serif">Require the causation</font> [ workingBase, previousCompletion ]<!--
        --> <font face="serif">for</font> completion.
    workingLIM = previousLIM
    previousCompletion = completion
done
